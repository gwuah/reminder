# Reminder

A productivity tool, that triggers a notification every hour. <br/>
You should take breaks too, you deserve better.

# Why

It's easier to build a bomb than to easily setup an alarm on your mac in 2020

# How to run

- go build main.go
- ./main (You are better of creating an alias for it)
